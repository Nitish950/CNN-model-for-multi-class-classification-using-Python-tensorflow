# CNN model for Fruit Image Classification

In this project, a CNN model is built using Keras(TensorFlow) in python for a multi-class classification of the fruit image dataset. 
The dataset consists of 90380 images of 131 different classes of fruits, divided into training and testing datasets of 67692 and 22688 images respectively.
The images in the dataset are of dimension 100x100.

**Tools utilized** : ipython, Keras, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib

Analysis Covered:

* CNN model created using maxpooling, convolutional,dropout and flatten layers
* Created validation set from the training set
* Visualization of loss and accuracy
* Heatmap visualization of the filters and convolutional layers


Accuracy of 99.7% and loss of 0.42% was achieved by the model created
